    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer = Estimation statistics involves the use of sample data to make inferences about population parameters. There are two main types of estimates: point estimates and interval estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to approximate a population parameter. It's essentially the best guess or most likely value for the parameter based on the available sample data.\n",
    "For example, if you calculate the mean (average) of a sample and use it as an estimate for the population mean, that calculated mean is a point estimate.\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate, on the other hand, provides a range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. Instead of giving a single value, it provides a level of confidence for the estimate.\n",
    "The most common type of interval estimate is a confidence interval. A confidence interval specifies a range of values and a level of confidence that the parameter is within that range. For instance, you might say, \"I am 95% confident that the population mean falls between X and Y.\"\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say you are estimating the average height of a certain population. A point estimate might be the mean height of a sample you've measured (e.g., 170 cm). An interval estimate, on the other hand, might be a 95% confidence interval for the mean height, such as 165 cm to 175 cm. This means that you are 95% confident that the true average height of the population lies within this range.\n",
